# Shell Basics

This is a brief guide to some basic concepts and commands for using a Unix-based shell.

## What is a Shell?

A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with an operating system by entering commands. The most commonly used shell on Unix-based systems is the Bash shell, but there are many other shells available.

## Navigating the File System

- `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
- `cd`: Change the current working directory.
- `ls`: List the contents of the current directory.

## Manipulating Files and Directories

- `touch`: Create a new, empty file.
- `mkdir`: Create a new directory.
- `cp`: Copy a file or directory.
- `mv`: Move or rename a file or directory.
- `rm`: Remove a file or directory.
